BIOS 

MBR ----> check hardware

CRUB

Kernel

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BIOS----> 
->basic i/o system
->first program that execute which is stored in read-only memory of mother board of computer
->perform post (power-on self-test ) verify the hardware components and peripheral to ensure if computer is working condition.
->check bootable device like pendrive , hardisk etc.
->handover control to first sector of device i.e MBR

apart from BIOS , UEFI ( unified extensive firmware interface ) is used

MBR
master boot record
512 bytes first sector of any bootable device contains machine code instructions to boot a machine and having following info 

bootloader (446 bytes)
partition table (64 bytes)
error checking ( 2 bytes)

it will load the boot loader into the memory and handover to it.


GRUB ---> grand unified boot loader

load /boot/grub2/grub.cfg at boot time

at this stage , user will see GUI asking different os or kernel configuration to boot.

once you selected the kernel , it locate the corresponding kernel binary

/boot/vmlinuz-<kernel-version>

main job is to load kernel and initrd/initramfs image into memory

once load kernel in RAM , it passes control to it.

in RHEL7

default boot loader is grub2 

grub is for 86 architecture, it could be different for other arch like intel itanium - ELILO

kernel ----> 

first kernel is loaded into read-only mode 

initramfs/initrd get decompressed and then first loads temporary file system

initrd then detect and load the drivers from temporary file system

mount other partition like lvm, raid etc and umount itself.

once main filesystem is mounted , kernel initialize the first process init/systemd

systemd ----> init system, runlevels (commonly referred to as targets in systemd) are replaced by unit files and targets, 
making the system's operation more flexible.

Runlevel 0 ----> poweroff

Runlevel 1 ----> single user mode

Runlevel 2 ----> multi user mode

Runlevel ----> multi user mode - networking

Runlevel 3 ----> provide cli mode 

Runlevel 4 ----> future use

Runlevel 5 ----> gui mode (graphical)

Runlevel 6 ----> reboot
