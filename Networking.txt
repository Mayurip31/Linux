***Networking***

Networking is the practice of connecting computers and other devices to share resources and information. 

Network: A network is a collection of interconnected devices, such as computers, servers, printers, and switches, that can communicate 
and share resources.

Nodes: Devices in a network are often referred to as nodes. These nodes can be computers, smartphones, servers, routers, or 
any other device capable of network communication.

Data: In networking, data is the information that devices exchange with each other. Data can be in the form of text, files, images, videos, 
or any other digital content.

Protocols: Protocols are a set of rules and conventions that govern how data is transmitted and received in a network. 
Common networking protocols include TCP/IP, HTTP, and DNS.

IP Address: An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a unique numerical label assigned to each device on a network.
IP addresses are used to identify and locate devices on the internet.

Subnet: A subnet is a range of IP addresses within a network. Subnetting is used to divide a large network into smaller,
more manageable segments.

Router: A router is a network device that connects different networks together and directs data traffic between them. 
It also assigns IP addresses within a local network.

Switch: A switch is a device that connects multiple devices within a local network, allowing them to communicate with each other. 
Switches operate at the data link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model.

Gateway: A gateway is a device or software that connects two dissimilar networks, allowing data to flow between them. 
Gateways are often used to connect local networks to the internet.

Firewall: A firewall is a security device or software that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic. 
It is used to protect networks from unauthorized access and potential threats.

DNS (Domain Name System): DNS is a system that translates human-readable domain names (e.g., www.example.com) into IP addresses. 
It is like a phone book for the internet.

Wireless Networking: Wireless networks use radio waves or other wireless technology to connect devices without the need for physical cables. 
Wi-Fi is a common example of wireless networking.

Bandwidth: Bandwidth refers to the capacity of a network to transmit data. It is usually measured in bits per second (bps)
 and is a key factor in determining network speed.

Packet: Data is typically broken down into packets for transmission over a network. Each packet contains a portion of the data, 
along with routing information.

Network Topology: Network topology refers to the physical or logical layout of a network. Common topologies include star, bus, ring, and mesh.

Network Security: Network security involves protecting a network and its data from unauthorized access, attacks, and
 threats. This includes measures like firewalls, encryption, and authentication.

OSI model(Open Systems Interconnection)

there are 7 layers of osi model

7.Application---->Provides network services directly to user applications, 
such as email, web browsers, and file transfer.

6.presentation---->Translates data into a format that can be understood by both sender and receiver, 
handling data encryption and compression.

5.session---->Manages and controls communication sessions, including establishing, maintaining, and 
terminating connections.

4.transport------>Ensures end-to-end communication and data integrity, handling flow control and error recovery.

3.network------>Manages routing and logical addressing, allowing data packets to be forwarded between different networks.

2.data link------> Responsible for data framing, error detection, and flow control within a local network segment.

1.physical ----->the physical transmission of data over
a medium, including specifications for cables, connectors, and signal encoding.

*ARAPANET developed tcp/ip model

SMTP for email, and FTP for file transfer.

3.transport----->Provides end-to-end communication, data segmentation, flow control, and error checking, 
including protocols like TCP (reliable) and UDP (unreliable).

2.internet---->Manages logical addressing (IP addresses), routing, and packet forwarding to enable data to traverse different networks.

1.network access---->Handles physical connections to the network, addressing within the local network, and basic data transmission.

Tcp
a connectionless transport layer protocol that offers low overhead and minimal error handling, making it suitable for real-time, 
low-latency applications like video streaming and online gaming.

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)	UDP (User Datagram Protocol)

Detects and retransmits lost             No automatic error detection

Network Devices:
   hub,switch,bridge,gateway,modem,router,etc.

Hub: An outdated device that broadcasts data to all connected devices within a network.

Switch: Connects devices within a local network, directing traffic based on MAC addresses.

Bridge: Connects two or more network segments and filters traffic based on MAC addresses.

Gateway: Connects networks with different protocols and helps data flow between them.

Modem: Converts digital data from a network to analog signals for transmission over telephone lines (DSL, dial-up) or
 cable systems (cable modem).

Router: Connects multiple networks, directs data between them, and assigns IP addresses.

An IP address (Internet Protocol address)

a unique numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication.

IP addresses serve two primary functions:

1.Identification:
IP addresses uniquely identify devices on a network. Every device, such as computers, smartphones, routers, and servers, has its own distinct IP address, 
which allows data to be routed to and from that device. 

2.Location Addressing: IP addresses are used to indicate the location of a device on a network or the internet. They help in directing data packets to the appropriate destination by 
specifying the source and destination of the data.

physical address ---> mac address - 48 bit (hexa decimel code)
IP addresses come in two primary versions:

1.IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4): This is the older and more widely used version, represented as four sets of numbers separated by periods 
IPv4 addresses are 32-bit long and have a limited number of unique addresses, 
which has led to the adoption of IPv6.

IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6): This is the newer version designed to overcome the limitations of IPv4. IPv6 addresses are 128-bit 
long and are represented in hexadecimal format, making them capable of accommodating an exponentially larger number of unique addresses.

classful ip --->A traditional IP addressing scheme where IP addresses are grouped into predefined classes 
(A, B, C, D, E) with fixed subnet structures.

classless ip--->A modern IP addressing scheme that allows for flexible subnetting by using variable-length subnet masks, 
providing efficient use of IP addresses and enabling route aggregation.
