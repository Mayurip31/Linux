***Process Management***

controlling, monitoring, and optimizing the execution of running programs and tasks on the operating system.

Process Types:

Foreground Process ----> A process that runs in the foreground and interacts with the user, taking input from the terminal.

Background Process ---->A process that runs in the background and doesn't require user interaction.

1.Shell Jobs ---> user created

2.doemon or system process

ps ----> Process Status 

p: This option displays information about all processes.

s: This option displays information in a structured format.

pid ----> unique process id

tty ----> terminal type of user logged in to

time ----> amount of cpu in min and sec that process has been running

cmd ----> name of the command that lunched the process

#most widely used command 

ps -e or A ----> to see all the running processes 

ps -ef ---> to full format about process

UID: The user ID of the process owner.

PID: The Process ID, a unique identifier for each running process.

PPID: The Parent Process ID, which is the ID of the process that spawned this one.

C: The CPU utilization or utilization of processor time by the process.

STIME: The start time of the process.

TTY: The terminal type associated with the process.

TIME: The total accumulated CPU time used by the process.

CMD: The command and arguments that started the process.

ps -elf ----> process related information status , pod , owner, ppid , ex- screenshot 

F: Flags associated with the process.

S: The process state, such as "R" for running or "S" for sleeping.

PRI: The process's priority.

NI: The nice value, which affects the process's priority.

ADDR: The memory address of the process (used by some display formats).

SZ: The size of the process in memory.

WCHAN: The name of the kernel function where the process is sleeping (if applicable).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ps -aux ----> It provides a detailed view of the processes.

%CPU: The percentage of CPU usage by the process.

%MEM: The percentage of physical memory (RAM) used by the process.

VSZ: Virtual memory size in kilobytes (KB) - the total memory the process is using.

RSS: Resident Set Size in kilobytes (KB) - the portion of VSZ that is in physical memory.

S< ----> highest priority
R+ ----> foreground process

SN -----> low priority


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
jobs ----> the jobs command is used to manage and display information about background jobs running within the current shell session.



sleep ---> to hold terminal

sleep 300 ---> hold terminal 300 second

jobs ---> to see running condition of job & stop condition of job

& ----> (used at the end of a command line) Starts the command immediately in the background.

ctrl+z ----> to stop shell job b temporarily

ctrl+c ---> to terminate or Can be used to cancel the current interactive job

ctrl+d ---> save & quit

fg job number ----> to foreground process
bg job number ----> to background process
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
kill - Terminate a process by its PID.

kill [options] PID

pkill - Signal processes based on their name.

pkill [options] process_name

killall - Signal processes based on their name (similar to pkill).

killall [options] process_name

kill -l - List available signal names and their corresponding numbers.

kill -l

#top ----> Display information about currently running processes.

top or htop ----> Interactive Process Viewer

Real-time system monitoring tool to view and manage processes with dynamic updates and sorting capabilities.

kill ---> Terminate a Process

Terminate a process by specifying its PID. Use kill -9 for a forceful termination if necessary.

killall ----> Kill Processes by Name

Terminate processes by specifying their names.

renice ---> Change Process Priority

Change the priority of a running process by adjusting its nice value.

nice ---> Run a Process with a Modified Priority

Launch a process with a specified priority using nice values
