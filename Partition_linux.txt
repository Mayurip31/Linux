***PARTITION***
"It is a way to divide a physical storage device, such as a hard drive or SSD"
the two main types of partitions

two different types of interfaces used for connecting storage devices, such as hard drives and optical drives.

SATA (Serial Advanced Technology Attachment)
PATA (Parallel Advanced Technology Attachment)

SATA                                 PATA
currently use                      outdated
fast                               slower 
speeds up to 6 Gbps                maximum transfer rate for PATA is 133 MB/s 
thinner and more flexible cables   wider and less flexible ribbon cables 
consume less power                 onsume more power 

MBR (Master Boot Record) 3 primary and 1 extended--> we can use 60 partition in extended or 4 primary
MBR is like an address book for your computer's hard drive.
MBR is older and has limitations, like supporting only up to 2.2TB of storage and having a limit of four partitions.
We use MBR on older computers with BIOS to boot the operating system.

GPT (GUID Partition Table)
GPT is a modern and improved version of MBR.
It's like a more organized and spacious address book for your hard drive.
GPT can handle much larger hard drives (more than 2.2TB) and allows for more partitions,
 so you can have lots of sections on your drive.

MBR and GPT are ways to keep your computer's hard drive organized and tell it where to find the operating system.

1.vertual box ---> setting----> storage----> sata---> ---.add hard disc ----> create hard disc    

lsblk---->Lists all available block devices (including partitions) and their sizes.

fdisk -l---->Displays the partition table for all disks on the system, 
showing the sizes and types of partitions.

primary partition
extende partition

fdisk utility to create a new partition on the specified disk. 

Follow the prompts to create the partition, specifying its size and type.
fdisk /dev/sdX-----> (replace X with the appropriate disk letter)
-m----> for help
-n---->to request new partition and give values of requesting fields.
p---> for primary
e---> for extended 
w----> for save and exit
d --->d command is used to delete

t--->for change system id.
L----> Hex code (type L to list all codes)

partprobe---->

blkid-----> to check file system.

mkfs---> for adding file system.

mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdXY (replace X and Y with the appropriate disk and partition numbers)

df -hT---->	
df---->Stands for "disk free
-h---->human-readable.
-T---->print filesystem type.

mount /dev/sdXY /mnt/mountpoint (replace X, Y, and /mnt/mountpoint----->for temporary 
umount /dev/sdxy /mnt---> for unmount.

vim /etc/fstab---->for permanent

mount -a ---> for refresh mount point
partprobe----> to refresh mount point.

/dev/sdb   /mnt    ext4 default 0 0

/dev/sdb1          /dir._name         ext4            defaults       0          0
<Partition_name>  <Mount_point>  <filesystem_type>   <permissions>  <dumps> <priorities>

1.Filesystem---->This field shows the device.

2.Type---->The type field indicates the filesystem type.

3.Options-->it isusedfor control permissions.

4.Dump---->The dump field specifies whether the filesystem should be backed up by the dump command. A value of 0 means no backup is performed, 
while a value of 1 or higher indicates that it should be backed up.

5.Pass--->The pass field determines the order in which filesystems are checked during the system's boot process for consistency. 
A value of 0 means that the filesystem should not be checked. Filesystems with higher pass values are checked later.


***Swap partition***
"swap space in Linux is used when the amount of physical memory is getting full. If the system 
needs more memory resource and the RAM is full, all inactive pages in memory moved to swap space." 

(swap should not be consider a replacement of RAM).

free or swapon---->To check the current swap usage.

fdisk /dev/sdb----->To create primary or extended partition.

mkswap /dev/sdb1----->Assign swap file system.

swapon /dev/sdb1----->Mount swap partition temporary.

vim /etc/fstab ------>For permanent mount.

/dev/sdb2 swap swap defaults 0 0 ---->Entry for swap partition.
Mount point should be swap.

swapon---->See swap partitions.

swapoff /dev/sdb1------>unmounts swap partitions.
