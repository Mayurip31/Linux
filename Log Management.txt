# centralized log server

Centralized logging is a method of collecting and managing log data from multiple sources to a single server, which simplifies log analysis and 
troubleshooting.

systemctl status rsyslog 

systemctl start rsyslog

#log_rotation

"Log rotation helps manage log files by compressing, archiving, and deleting older log files to 
prevent them from consuming too much disk space."

vim /etc/logrotate.conf ----> configuration of log rotation

/etc/logrotate.d ----> libvirtd file typically contains log rotation configurations for the libvirtd service, 
which is used for managing virtual machines.

weekly ----> Rotates the log files on a weekly basis.

missingok ----> Ignores errors if the log file is missing.

rotate 4 ----> Retains 4 rotated log files.

delaycompress ----> Delays compression of log files until the next rotation.

copytruncate ----> to create a copy of the current log file before rotation and then truncate the original log file. It helps in preserving
the log file content while allowing new data to be written to it.

minsize 100k ----> sets the minimum size for log rotation to occur. Log files must be at least 100 kilobytes (100k) in size before logrotate 
will initiate the rotation process. If the log file is smaller, rotation will not take place.
