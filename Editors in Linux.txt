Editors are used to create new files, and edit or modify the content inside it. 

Simply editors are used to read and write data in existing or newly created file. 

Editors can be classified on the basis of interfaces that they use, i.e. Graphical Editors and Command Line Editors.

Graphical editor:

Graphical editor uses graphical user interface. It is easy to use but consumes more memory than command line editors. In Linux, following are some well-known graphical editors,

1. gedit: - It is same as that of notepad in windows. You can open gedit graphically in application menu and also using command as $gedit.

2. kedit: - It is similar to gedit but contain some advance features. Generally, we have to install kedit separately to use it.

3. Open office: - Open Office is same as that of MS Office. This Open Office is specially developed for Linux based operating systems.

Command line editor:

Command line editor uses command line interface. 

These editors are much master and consumes less memory than any graphical editors. 

Following are some well-known command line editors,

1. nano: - nano editor is easy to use since it provides simple features to edit data from files.

Syntax-
# nano <filename>.<extension>

2. pico: - 

Syntax-
# pico <filename>

3. vi and vim: - 

vi (virtual interface) and vim (virtual interface modified) are most commonly used editors. 

vi and vim both editors are same where as vim is the advance version of vi editor. 

Thus, it contains some additional features. 

These editors works in four different modes,
