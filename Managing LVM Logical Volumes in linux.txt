***Managing LVM Logical Volumes***
Logical Volume Management (LVM):
LVM is a disk management technology used in CentOS and other Linux distributions. It allows for flexible and dynamic management of 
storage by creating logical volumes from physical storage devices, enabling features like resizing and snapshots.

Initial Disk Preparation:

Identify the disks you want to use for LVM---->/dev/sdb

To create partitions on the disks if they're not already partitioned----->Use fdisk

Initialize Physical Volumes (PV):

pvcreate /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdb2----> to initialize your disk partitions as physical volume.

pvs ----->list of physical volumes.

pvdisplay ------>show details of physical.

Create a Volume Group (VG):

vgcreate myvg /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdb2---->Combine one or more physical volumes into a volume group using the vgcreate.

vgs ----->list of volume.

vgdisplay ------>details of volume.

Create Logical Volumes (LV):

lvcreate -L 10G -n mylv myvg----->To create logical volumes within your volume group.

lvs ----->list of logical volumes

lvdisplay ----->show details of logical volumes.

Create file system:

mkfs.ext4 /dev/myvg/mylv----->the logical volume using a filesystem, e.g., ext4.

Create a mount point directory:

mount /dev/myvg/mylv /mnt---->Mount the logical volume.

Resize Logical Volumes (Advanced):

lvextend -L +2G /dev/myvg/mylv----->resize logical volumes using the lvextend and resize2fs commands.
resize2fs /dev/myvg/mylv------>resize ext type volumes.

vgextend myvg /dev/sdb3 ------>sdb3 is physical volume added into volume group.

vgeeduce myvg /dev/sdb3----->sdb3 is physical volume reduce from your volume group.

vg rename myvg myvg1----->to rename vg group name.

Reduce volumes using LVM.

To reduce logical volumes, first unmounts the logical volume and clear processes if any running on 
that partition. Reduction is possible only in extended type of file system

umount /dev/vg_demo/lv1---->unmount l

fsck.ext4 –f /dev/myvg/lv1---->clear processes.

e2fsck –f /dev/myvg/lv1---->if error occur for above command.

lvreduce –L -50M /dev/myvg/lv1----->reduce logical.

Remove volumes using LVM:

lvremove /dev/myvg/lv1----->remove logical volume.

vgremove myvg----->remove volume group when all lv remove.

pvremove /dev/sdb1------>remove physical volume when all vg remove.
